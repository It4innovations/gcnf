# Graph Convolutional Network Framework

GCN is an open source Tensorflow-based framework for developing deep learning applications operating on arbitrary graph structures.

## Examples

Examples can be found at  `gcnf/examples`.

### Node-level features

*  `gcnf/examples/node_degrees.py` demostrates how to learn node degrees

### Graph-level features

*  `gcnf/examples/graph_node_count.py` demostrates how to learn number of nodes in graphs
